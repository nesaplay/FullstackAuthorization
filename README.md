# Fullstack Authorization Project
This is a Client + Server Side Signup/Signin Authorization project. Here I'm showing the usage of encrypted passwords and tokens used to authenticate requests, consumed by React/Redux application. 
```    
Client: Form validation and authenticated API requests.  
```
```
Server: Passport Strategies used in combination with JWT Tokens. MongoDB localy 
wired. Bcrypt password hashing.
